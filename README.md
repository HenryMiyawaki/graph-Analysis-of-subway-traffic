# Adjascent Matrix

An adjacency matrix is a mathematical representation of a graph in which each row and column correspond to a vertex, and the entries indicate whether there is an edge between the corresponding vertices. Specifically, the entry in row i and column j is 1 if there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j, and 0 otherwise.

The adjacency matrix is an important tool for representing and analyzing graphs because it allows us to easily determine which vertices are adjacent to each other, and how many edges a vertex has. It can also be used to compute various graph metrics, such as the degree sequence, clustering coefficient, and shortest paths between vertices.

Regarding the provided file, it is the final version of an adjacency matrix that has been processed using a Python script. This suggests that the file contains the matrix entries in a format that can be read and analyzed by a Python program.

the following command was runned to create the matrix:

`python .\generate_relationship_table.py merge_duplicated turnoff_interception save`
